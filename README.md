# Banking chatbot using Amazon Lex and AWS Lambda

Amazon Lex is one of the services of AWS (Amazon Web Services) which provides any developer to build conversational chatbots quickly. Amazon Lex bot is powered by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities, the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa.

To create a bot you just need to provide the flow of conversation. Lex manages the dialogue and dynamically adjust the responses in the conversation. Using AWS console, you can build, test and publish your bot. You can also integrate your bot with mobile application, web application and chat platforms (for example, Facebook messenger).

Amazon Lex provides pre-built integration with AWS Lambda, you can also integrate other services like Amazon Cognito, AWS Mobile Hub, Amazon Cloudwatch, Amazon DynamoDB. Amazon Lex is fully secured, there is no upfront cost and it works with pay as you go pricing. You can create Lambda functions and add them as code hooks in your intent configuration to perform user data validation and fulfillment tasks.

In my project, I have built Banking chatbot which responses the general queries regarding account, loan, debit/credit cards etc.

I have attached the .py files for lambda function.
